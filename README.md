# Web-Server
This project is a web server built with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. It features user registration and login, with proper validation and error handling, using JSON Web Tokens for authentication. The user profile can be updated with an avatar image using Multer middleware for file uploading.

The core functionality of the project includes creating, updating, and deleting posts, all with proper validation using middleware. Posts can be filtered by name, as well as sorted by latest, last week, and last month. The project also features a search bar for searching through post titles, descriptions, and author names.

Throughout the project, attention has been given to proper error handling to ensure a robust and stable backend. The code has been structured in a modular way, with separation of concerns and a clear use of middleware for validation and other tasks. All database interactions are handled using Mongoose, a powerful and flexible Object Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB.

Overall, this project showcases strong skills in backend development with Node.js and related libraries
